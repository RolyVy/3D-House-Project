Understanding the What and the Why of the client request :

#### What new libraries should I learn about? And what for?



### *What and Why explained*

The project aim to **model houses from a single home address**

  * Being able to translate an address, physical adress into geo data point
  * Be able to create a 3D model from point clouds

It is for **insurrance business purposes** 
 > And Therefore include informations for this sector purposes

Important points :

* living area

* garden
* pool
