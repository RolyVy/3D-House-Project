## Definitions

### *What is it?*

* **shapefiles** : The shapefile format is a geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software.

The shapefile format can spatially describe vector features: **points, lines, and polygons**, representing, for example, water wells, rivers, and lakes. Each item usually has attributes that describe it, such as name or temperature.

Shapefile shape index format (.shx)
Shapefile attribute format (.dbf)
Shapefile spatial index format (.sbn)
